This folder contains projects I worked on while working for the Melissa Powers for Prosecutor campaign in Hamilton County, OH.
  I used 2020 election results, found on the Board of Elections website to predict results for the 2024 election. I compared the 2020 prosecutor elect, Joe Deters, to my candidate.
  Additionally, after the election, I compared 2020 results to 2024 results to see what my campaign could have done different.
