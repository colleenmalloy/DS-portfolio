## DS-portfolio
This is my Data Science portfolio from all the projects and assignments I worked on during my time at Xavier University, Ohio. It includes projects from a summer internship, where I collaborated with my cohort on discovering the distributions of different aspects of the core curriculum at Xavier, my BAIS 462 Programming in Analytics course, and data science work I completed on Melissa Powers for Prosecutor (Hamilton, County) campaign.
